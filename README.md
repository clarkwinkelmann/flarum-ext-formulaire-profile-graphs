This is a companion extension to my premium [Formulaire extension](https://kilowhat.net/flarum/extensions/formulaire) for which you need a valid subscription.

This extension is not part of the Extiverse premium extension support agreement.

Adds an option to display profile fields multi-entry data as graphs and control its public visibility per-user.
